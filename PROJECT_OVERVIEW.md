# Real Estate Profit Calculator - Project Overview

## Purpose
A web-based calculator designed to help real estate investors analyze the profitability of property investments by separating capital gains (buy/sell transactions) from operational income (monthly rental operations).

## Problem Statement
Real estate investors need to understand two distinct profit streams:
1. **Capital Appreciation**: Profit from buying low and selling high
2. **Cash Flow**: Profit from monthly rental operations

Combining these in a single calculation obscures the true performance of each component. An investor might have excellent cash flow but poor capital gains, or vice versa.

## Solution
A three-tab calculator that:
- Separates buy/sell profit calculations from monthly operational profit
- Provides clear visibility into each profit stream
- Combines both to show total investment performance

## Target Users
- Real estate investors evaluating property deals
- House flippers analyzing flip potential
- Buy-and-hold investors tracking rental performance
- Anyone analyzing real estate investment opportunities

## Key Features
1. **Buy/Sell Analysis**: Calculate profit from property acquisition and disposition
2. **Monthly Operations**: Track rental income vs. holding costs
3. **Total Profit View**: Combined analysis with ROI and margin metrics
4. **Visual Charts**: Graphical representation of profit breakdown
5. **Real-time Calculations**: Instant updates as inputs change
